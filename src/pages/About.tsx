                Hi, My name is Kiefer Court. I am originally from Marshall County in western Kentucky,
                but I currently live in Louisville, Kentucky. I graduated from the University of Louisville in May of 2025
                with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and a Certificate in Applied Geospatial Technologies.
                I could see myself working in a variety of fields, including software development, web development,
                Geographic Information Systems (GIS), or even cybersecurity.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I started my computer science journey in high school, where I was able to pass both the 
                AP Computer Science A and AP Computer Science Principles exams. This lead me to become a computer science major
                at the University of Louisville. However, I also developed a passion for GIS during my time there,
                which led me to pursue a Certificate in Applied Geospatial Technologies. My coding experience compliments
                my GIS skills well, allowing me to automate workflows that may take days or weeks to complete manually.
              </p>

              <p>

                  GIS
                </h2>
                I currently work as a GIS Analyst at the Paducah McCracken County Joint Sewer Agency 
                where I spent two summers as an intern while in school. I manage sewer utilities on arcPro and arcGIS Online.
                Some of my relevant coursework from the University of Louisville includes Web Mapping, GIS Programming, GIS &amp; Urban Demography, Advanced GIS,
                Software Engineering, Python &amp; Data Analytics, Design of Operating Systems, Data Structures,
                Mobile Device Programming. I feel very confident in my ability to work with GIS software and tools, and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills.

              <p>
                As of today I have been coding for over 5 years starting in high school. I have experioence in
                virtually every major programming language, including Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, SQL, and more.
                I have worked on a vaariety of projects while in school, along with some personal projects. While I have no work experience
                specific to computer science, I do use python wuite a bit in my current job to automate workflows and processes. On top of
                that I have a strong desire to learn and grow in the field of computer science, and I am always looking for new challenges to tackle.
                I pride myself as a good learner, for instance I taught myself how to make React websites like the one you are currently viewing. I see 
                myself as extremely qualified for an entry level software development (or related field) position, 
                and I am eager to apply my skills in a professional setting.
              </p>

                </h2>

              <p>
                I see cybersecurity as a great field to get into, and I have a strong interest in it. My dad works in IT
                and my uncle works in cybersecurity, so I have been exposed to it from a young age. I am currently working on
                the CompTIA Security+ certification, which I hope to complete by the end of 2025.
                I have a strong understanding of networking, operating systems, and security principles, and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills.
